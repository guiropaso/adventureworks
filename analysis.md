<h1 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and product performance to provide actionable insights that drive business decisions. By leveraging the AdventureWorks dataset, we will identify key trends, find our ideal customers, and optimize product offerings to enhance revenue and profitability.</p>
<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<ul>
<li>Analyze demographic and transactional data to define the characteristics of high-value customers</li>
<li>Evaluate the impact of demographics (marital status, income, gender, etc.) on purchasing behavior</li>
<li>Identify top-performing products based on sales volume and revenue</li>
<li>Evaluate how different product categories contribute to total revenue</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="data-description">Data Description</h1>
<p>The AdventureWorks dataset is a relational database that stores business transaction data for a bikes and accesories manufacturing company. The dataset is structured using multiple schemas (e.g., Sales, Production, Person), with tables linked via primary and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and product performance using 2 datasets:</p>
<p>Customer Details: This dataset includes information about our customers, such as their demographics (age, gender, income), and buying habits. By analyzing these details, we can profile our ideal customers and understand their preferences.</p>
<p>Order and Product details: This dataset includes information about the orders such as order quantities and amount, order dates, territories, etc. and information about the products such as categories and sub-categories.</p>
<h1 id="comprehensive-performance-report">Comprehensive Performance Report</h1>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Over the past two years, AdventureWorks’ average order value has dropped by nearly 80%, yet total revenue has doubled, driven primarily by bike sales, which account for 86% of total sales. The Southwest region leads with 22% of total revenue, making it the most crucial market. Our analysis also uncovered the ideal customer profile: married homeowners, commuting less than a mile, with moderate incomes ($25K–$75K), no more than two children, and up to two cars. These insights highlight opportunities to optimize bike sales, target high-performing regions, and refine marketing efforts to drive sustainable growth.</p>
<h2 id="key-findings--business-implications">Key Findings &amp; Business Implications</h2>
<p><strong>Declining Average Order Value, Yet Rising Revenue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The average order value has dropped by nearly 80% in the last two years.</li>
<li>Despite this decline, total revenue has doubled (+100%), indicating an increase in transaction volume rather than higher-value purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bicycles Drive the Business</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bikes account for 86% of total sales, making them the primary revenue driver.</li>
<li>The strong demand for this category suggests an opportunity to refine pricing, promotions, and inventory strategies around bike sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Southwest Territory Leads in Sales Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Southwest region generates 22% of total sales, making it the most critical market</li>
<li>Regional sales trends suggest a need for targeted marketing and localized promotions to maintain and expand this stronghold</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defining the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)</strong><br>
Through demographic analysis, we identified the AdventureWorks ideal customer, which provides valuable insights for targeted marketing and product positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marital Status: Married</li>
<li>Commute Distance: Less than 1 mile</li>
<li>Vehicle Ownership: No more than 2 cars</li>
<li>Children: No more than 2</li>
<li>Annual Income: Between $25,000 – $75,000</li>
<li>Home Ownership: Homeowner</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="strategic-recommendations">Strategic Recommendations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Optimize Bike Inventory &amp; Pricing: Given their dominant role in sales, refining pricing, supply chain efficiency, and promotional offers for bikes can maximize profitability.</li>
<li>Regional Expansion &amp; Targeted Promotions: Expanding on the Southwest’s strong performance, investing in localized marketing campaigns can help boost retention and sales</li>
<li>Refined Customer Segmentation &amp; Targeting: Tailoring advertising, email campaigns, and loyalty programs for the identified ideal customer profile will improve conversion rates and customer lifetime value.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach provides a clear picture of revenue trends, customer demographics, and market opportunities. By leveraging these insights, AdventureWorks can refine its sales strategy, enhance customer engagement, and drive sustained business growth.</p>
